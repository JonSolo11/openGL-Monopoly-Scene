How do I approach designing software?

The first step is to conceptualize and thoroughly understand the problem at hand and the solution. These need to be broken down into small pieces to craft the requirements for the application and 
establish the requirements and functionality aspects. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has exposed me to creating something based on a source image, breaking it down to it's smallest objects (triangles), and the path required to create a complete scene from those components. This
project included creating objects, combining objects, applying multiple shaders and blending them, lighting objects and positioning them relative to one another to create a complete scene. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?

The steps were broken down into functional components. The first step was setting up a scene and various libraries to construct a triangle. Then movement and camera components were added. Then more complex 
objects with textures were added. Then multiple objects were combined to make a larger object like the hotels on the board. It's crucial to start with the basic fundamental components and working on one small 
object to construct the foundation that can be built upon to create the final scene. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

This project was a fantastic example of choosing a component, seeing it through to its completion, and then implementing it into the scene and building on it brick by brick. This is a necessary skill to 
ensure through and complete progress is made on an application without scope creep. It truly allowed me to remain focused on the task at hand and commit completely to the short term objective which allowed
me to overcome roadblocks and learn systematically. 

How do I approach developing programs?

I truly view programs as a flowchart in my head. Once I have an understanding of the requirements, I begin to build that flowchart down to the unit level. I then choose the most crucial functional components
and build those. For example, there was a point in time where this application simply displayed a white triangle. Once I reached that point, the next step was clearly camera and movement constrols so I could 
navigate around my objects to scrutinize them in more detail. With larger program, I tend to take notes on my progress. I like to include what was accomplished that day and what still needs to be done. That
way when I return to the project, I have a firm grasp of my goals without having to reacclimate myself. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Although not new, I found myself reading documentation far more on this project as openGL was completely new to me. Testing was another crucial component to this project. I built small functions that allowed me to 
test more easily saving me time and allowing me to translate objects more effictively. 

How did iteration factor into your development?

Based on my answers so far, it's safe to say that iteration wasn't simply a factor in my development but a core piece to my development cycle. Once the foundation was built in this project, building it out
was a matter of completing many iteration with incremantal improvement on small components that accumulated to bring the project to completion over time. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach evolved by not chosing a singular appraoch. Each compoenent consisted of it's own unique challenges and many required a different source or tactic to overcome. My approach evolved by adapting to 
the circumstance I am in and using various resources and tools to overcome that problem instead of forcing a singular approach until it worked. Sometimes I needed to research, sometimes I needed code and test 
aggressively, sometimes I needed a break. The evolution came throughout the course as I was able to analyze the problem and the approach I was using to come up with a solution to keep consistent iterative progress.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational and professional pathway?

My goals are simply to do something I have a passion for as a career. The passion for computer science has never been stronger and continues to grow daily. As the challenges grow, so does my passion. Regarding
computational graphics and visualization and its impact on my professional and educational goals, the knowledge and skills gained from a project this large reach much further than being able to check a box on
an application. I could never use openGL again and the impact would still be immense on my future. This project challenged me in my skills, my approach, my self reflection, my ability to adapt and so much more. 
Those experiences have made me a better developer across the board and I will continue to to build upon those lessons as I continue my educational and profession journeys.
